# CSC-305 Final Project

## Step Bet

Modern fitness apps excel at tracking progress but often lack engaging user interaction or meaningful rewards for achievements. Imagine hiking over 10 miles or achieving new personal bests, only to receive a generic "Great Job!" message. Our project aims to transform fitness tracking by integrating fun, interactive elements inspired by casino gaming.

## Features:
- **Gamified Fitness Tracking:** Earn in-game tokens based on Steps Taken.
- **Casino Games:** Enjoy Blackjack, Plinko, and Mines games using earned tokens.
- **Virtual Economy:** Use game earnings for ranks, titles, and profile pictures.
- **Cokmmunity Leaderboards:** See the top 5 leaders in categories, such as Tokens, Bets, Bet Amount, Steps, and Vault Value.
- **Community Challenges:** Check the Community Challenge page to complete tasks and earn more tokens as rewards.
